# Open-source, advanced color difference formulas

This repository contains the CIE (International Commission on illumination) L* a* b* (also known as CIELAB) distance metric (ΔE*) formulas *ΔE_1976*, *ΔE_CMC*, *ΔE_1994* and *ΔE_2000* in VBA for Excel.

The implementation of the ΔE_2000 formula has been made possible thanks to the resources published by Mr. Gaurav Sharma, one of the developers of the formula, on his institutional [website](https://hajim.rochester.edu/ece/sites/gsharma/ciede2000/), which was very helpful given the real complexity of the algorithm.

As an example, this is a table with results where, for aesthetics, the decimals were truncated:
